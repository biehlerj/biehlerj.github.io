# Hello! My name is Jacob Biehler

I am a full stack software engineer with experience in Typescript, React, Java, Python, Docker and so much more. I work at [Moebius Solutions](https://www.moesol.com/) and have worked on a variety of different projects.

I am passionate about Linux and Free and Open Source Software and Hardware. In my spare time I enjoy learning new programming languages and open source software, playing video games, going outdoors on a hike, a bike ride, or camping. I also enjoy watching anime and reading manga and light novels.
