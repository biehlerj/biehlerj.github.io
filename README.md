# My personal website

This repository contains the code for my [personal website](https://biehlerj.xyz) written in Hugo. This is a rewrite of my [previous personal website](https://biehlerj.github.io) written using Next.js. ~~It currently uses [my fork](https://github.com/biehlerj/hugo-PaperMod) of the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) until my changes get pulled in~~My changes to the PaperMod theme were merged into `master` in [this commit]([621c9f60fbf5fb96415fa2c031d50c83514164a8](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/commit/621c9f60fbf5fb96415fa2c031d50c83514164a8)). It is currently deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with plans to deploy to [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8950079).
