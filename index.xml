My contribution to Cointop was to make sure that the configuration file was read from and added to the user&amp;rsquo;s declared config directory otherwise it would use a standardized path.
The previous behavior would override the user&amp;rsquo;s config directory. For instance on Linux if you had $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defined the config.toml file for Cointop would be placed into $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/cointop/ rather than $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cointop/.</description></item><item><title>Conveyor</title><link>https://biehlerj.xyz/projects/conveyor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 22:19:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://biehlerj.xyz/projects/conveyor/</guid><description>Conveyor is a series of frontend libraries for building an AutoInvent (which is a portmanteau of Automatic Inventory) application.
