# My personal website

This repository contains the code for my [personal website](https://biehlerj.xyz) written in Hugo. This is a rewrite of my [previous personal website](https://biehlerj.github.io) written using Next.js. It currently uses [my fork](https://github.com/biehlerj/hugo-PaperMod) of the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) until my changes get pulled in. It is deployed on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8950079).

## TODOs

1. Automate build and deployment to [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8950079) using [Sourcehut's build tool](https://builds.sr.ht)
2. Create blog with the following initial articles:
   1. Why I switched from Github to Sourcehut
   2. Why I switched from Next.js to Hugo for my website
   3. My dotfiles and why I use Pop!_OS
   4. My experience with the [HP Dev One](https://hpdevone.com/)
3. Add RSS for blog
