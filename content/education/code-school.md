At the coding school I attended in San Francisco I learned full stack software engineering. The curriculum covered shell
scripting, systems programming with C, backend web development with Python, Flask, and MySQL, frontend web development
with JavaScript and JQuery, and DevOps with Puppet, Python, uwsgi, and Nginx. The curriculum was project based with the
final project culminating in building a full stack clone of Airbnb.

There was not only a focus on practical software engineering skills, but also theoretical knowledge and technical
interview prep. The curriculum included learning common algorithms and data structures like breadth first search and
linked lists.
