credit score, dispute credit inaccuracies, and protect credit data.

- Added new routes to the RESTful API for credit management services
- Created administrator tools to manage customer accounts, get sales data, and allow for 3rd parties to be added
to the service
- Fixed a bug in the email template API to correctly format and send emails to customers
